# Demo Feed Viewer

I created this application with `react-native init` command and `typescript-template`.

Also, I will use `yarn` when developing this application. To install `yarn` you can check this [page](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

## Requirements

- [ ] Create a react native app
- [ ] Mock the data with an API
- [ ] Use Redux for global state management
- [ ] Use Styled Components for styling
- [ ] When I launched the app, it should direct me to the Feed view
- [ ] The feed view should be a scrollable list
- [ ] The feed view should show 10 feeds initially
- [ ] Each feed should have an author and a body of content which is limited to 100 characters
- [ ] Each author should have an avatar and a name
- [ ] When I scroll to the top of the list and pull down, it should refresh and load newer feeds
- [ ] When I scroll to the bottom, it should load older posts with lazy loading
- [ ] When I select one of the feeds, it should go to a new screen to show the details of that feed in a more pleasant way
- [ ] In feed detail page, the app should show the avatar and the name of the author and the body of the feed
- [ ] I should be able to navigate back from the feed detail page
- [ ] When I navigated from the feed detail to home, list should automatically scroll to the last element that I opened
- [ ] If I press the Author's avatar or name in the feed detail view, the app should take me to the Profile page for that Author
